# pkg/downloader/uri_test.go  
## Package: downloader_test  
  
### Imports:  
- github.com/mudler/LocalAI/pkg/downloader  
- github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2  
- github.com/onsi/gomega  
  
### External Data, Input Sources:  
- The code uses the `URI` function from the `downloader` package to parse and download resources from various sources, including GitHub repositories and direct URLs.  
  
### Gallery API tests:  
- The code defines a set of tests for the Gallery API, which is responsible for downloading and managing model gallery resources.  
- The tests cover different scenarios for parsing and downloading resources from GitHub repositories, including cases with and without a specified branch.  
- The tests also cover cases where the resource is provided as a direct URL.  
  
### URI parsing and download:  
- The `URI` function is used to parse the input string and extract the necessary information for downloading the resource.  
- The `DownloadWithCallback` method is used to download the resource asynchronously and execute a callback function when the download is complete.  
- The callback function in the tests verifies that the downloaded URL and content match the expected values.  
  
### Test cases:  
- The code includes three test cases for parsing and downloading resources from GitHub repositories:  
    - `parses github with a branch`: Tests the parsing of a GitHub URI with a specified branch.  
    - `parses github without a branch`: Tests the parsing of a GitHub URI without a specified branch, using the default branch (main).  
    - `parses github with urls`: Tests the parsing of a GitHub URI with direct URLs.  
  
### Summary:  
The code provides a set of tests for the Gallery API, which is responsible for downloading and managing model gallery resources. The tests cover different scenarios for parsing and downloading resources from GitHub repositories and direct URLs. The tests use the `URI` function and the `DownloadWithCallback` method to parse and download the resources, and they verify that the downloaded URL and content match the expected values.
