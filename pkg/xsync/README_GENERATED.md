# xsync

This package provides a way to synchronize data between two locations. It uses a data structure called SyncMap to store and retrieve key-value pairs. The package includes a test suite to ensure the functionality of the SyncMap.

## Files:

- map.go
- map_test.go
- sync_suite_test.go

## Environment Variables, Flags, and Command-Line Arguments:

- None

## Edge Cases:

- None

## Code Summary:

The `map.go` file defines the SyncMap data structure and its methods. The SyncMap is a key-value store that allows for setting, getting, deleting, and checking the existence of key-value pairs.

The `map_test.go` file contains unit tests for the SyncMap data structure. It uses the Go testing package to verify the functionality of the SyncMap methods.

The `sync_suite_test.go` file contains a test suite for the LocalAI sync functionality. It uses the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library to run the tests. The test suite includes a test case called `TestSync` that verifies the synchronization of data between two locations.

## Relations Between Code Entities:

- The `map.go` file defines the SyncMap data structure, which is used in the `sync_suite_test.go` file to test the LocalAI sync functionality.

## Unclear Places and Dead Code:

- None
