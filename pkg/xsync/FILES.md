### SyncMap  
  
This section describes the SyncMap data structure and its functionality.  
  
#### Syncmap  
  
The SyncMap is a data structure that provides a way to store and retrieve key-value pairs. It has methods for setting, getting, deleting, and checking the existence of key-value pairs.  
  
#### Sets and Gets  
  
The `Set` method is used to store a key-value pair in the SyncMap. The `Get` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a given key.  
  
#### Deletes  
  
The `Delete` method is used to remove a key-value pair from the SyncMap. The `Exists` method can be used to check if a key exists in the SyncMap.

### Summary:  
  
The code in this package defines a test suite for the LocalAI sync functionality. It utilizes the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega assertion library.  
  
The `TestSync` function is the entry point for the test suite. It registers the `Fail` function as the fail handler and runs the test suite with the name "LocalAI sync test".
