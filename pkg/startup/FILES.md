### Summary:  
  
#### Preload test:  
  
This section tests the functionality of the `InstallModels` function, which is responsible for preloading models from various sources. It includes several test cases that cover different scenarios, such as loading from remote URLs, embedded full-urls, embedded short-urls, and embedded models.  
  
1. Loading from remote URLs: This test case creates a temporary directory and downloads a model library from a remote URL. It then verifies that the downloaded model library contains the expected model information.  
  
2. Loading from embedded full-urls: This test case creates a temporary directory and downloads a model configuration from an embedded full-url. It then verifies that the downloaded model configuration contains the expected model information.  
  
3. Loading from embedded short-urls: This test case creates a temporary directory and downloads a model from an embedded short-url. It then verifies that the downloaded model contains the expected model information.  
  
4. Loading from embedded models: This test case creates a temporary directory and downloads a model from an embedded model name. It then verifies that the downloaded model contains the expected model information.  
  
5. Downloading from URLs: This test case downloads a model from a URL using the `InstallModels` function. It then verifies that the downloaded model exists in the specified directory.  
  
In summary, this package provides a set of tests to ensure that the `InstallModels` function can successfully preload models from various sources, including remote URLs, embedded full-urls, embedded short-urls, and embedded models.
