Let's dive into the world of API documentation and how to generate it using Swagger. Swagger, now known as OpenAPI, is a widely adopted standard for defining and documenting RESTful APIs. It provides a machine-readable format for describing the API's structure, endpoints, parameters, and more. This makes it easier for developers to understand and consume the API.  
  
In this response, I'll guide you through the process of generating Swagger documentation for your API, along with a comprehensive example to illustrate the concepts.  
  
1. Install the necessary tools:  
  
   - Go: The primary programming language for your API.  
   - Swagger/OpenAPI generator: A tool to generate the Swagger documentation from your API code. Popular options include Swagger Codegen and OpenAPI Generator.  
  
2. Annotate your API code:  
  
   - Use annotations or attributes provided by the Swagger/OpenAPI generator to describe your API endpoints, parameters, request bodies, response bodies, and other relevant information. These annotations will be used to generate the Swagger documentation.  
  
3. Generate the Swagger documentation:  
  
   - Use the Swagger/OpenAPI generator to generate the Swagger documentation from your annotated API code. This will typically result in a YAML or JSON file containing the API's definition.  
  
4. Host the Swagger documentation:  
  
   - You can host the generated Swagger documentation on a web server or use a dedicated Swagger UI tool to provide an interactive interface for exploring the API.  
  
Now, let's look at a concrete example to illustrate these steps. Suppose you have a simple API endpoint that takes a string as input and returns a greeting message. Here's how you might annotate your code and generate the Swagger documentation:  
  
```go  
package main  
  
import (  
	"net/http"  
	"encoding/json"  
)  
  
type Greeting struct {  
	Message string `json:"message"`  
}  
  
func handleGreeting(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {  
	name := r.URL.Query().Get("name")  
	greeting := Greeting{Message: "Hello, " + name
