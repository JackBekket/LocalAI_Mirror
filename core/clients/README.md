# Package: clients

### Imports:

* bytes
* encoding/json
* fmt
* io
* net/http

### External Data, Input Sources:

* The package uses the `net/http` package to communicate with a remote API.
* The API endpoint is assumed to be accessible at the base URL provided during the initialization of the `StoreClient`.

### Code Summary:

#### StoreClient Struct:

The `StoreClient` struct is responsible for interacting with the remote API. It holds the base URL of the API and an instance of the `http.Client` for making HTTP requests.

#### API Request Methods:

The package provides methods for performing various API requests, including:

* `Set`: Stores data in the remote store.
* `Get`: Retrieves data from the remote store.
* `Delete`: Deletes data from the remote store.
* `Find`: Searches for similar data in the remote store.

#### Helper Functions:

The package includes two helper functions:

* `doRequest`: Performs a request without expecting a response body.
* `doRequestWithResponse`: Performs a request and parses the response body.

#### Data Structures:

The package defines several data structures to represent the data exchanged with the remote API, including:

* `SetRequest`: Represents the data to be stored in the remote store.
* `GetRequest`: Represents the data to be retrieved from the remote store.
* `GetResponse`: Represents the data retrieved from the remote store.
* `DeleteRequest`: Represents the data to be deleted from the remote store.
* `FindRequest`: Represents the data to be used for searching similar data in the remote store.
* `FindResponse`: Represents the data returned by the search operation.

#### Constructor:

The `NewStoreClient` function creates a new instance of the `StoreClient` struct, taking the base URL of the API as input.

#### Error Handling:

The package includes error handling for API requests, returning an error if the request fails or the response status code is not 200 (OK).
