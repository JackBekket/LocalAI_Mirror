## Package: explorer_test

### Imports:
- os
- github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2
- github.com/onsi/gomega
- github.com/mudler/LocalAI/core/explorer

### External Data, Input Sources:
- The code uses a temporary file path for the database, which is created in the `BeforeEach` function.
- The database file is cleaned up in the `AfterEach` function.

### Summary:

#### Database Management:

The code defines a test suite for the `explorer.Database` struct, which is responsible for managing tokens. The test suite includes several test cases that cover the following functionalities:

1. Adding and retrieving a token: The test case verifies that a token can be added to the database using the `Set` method and retrieved using the `Get` method.

2. Deleting a token: The test case ensures that a token can be deleted from the database using the `Delete` method.

3. Persisting data to disk: The test case checks that the database data is persisted to disk and can be loaded back into memory when the database object is recreated.

4. Loading an empty or non-existent file: The test case verifies that the database starts with an empty database when a new database object is created with an empty or non-existent file.

The test suite uses the `ginkgo` testing framework and the `gomega` assertion library to perform the tests. The tests are organized into contexts and it blocks, which help to structure the test suite and make it easier to understand.
