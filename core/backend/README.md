## Package: backend

### Imports:

- testing
- github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2
- github.com/onsi/gomega

### External Data and Input Sources:

- None

### Summary:

This package contains a test suite for the backend component. It uses the Ginkgo testing framework and the Gomega matchers for assertions. The `TestBackend` function registers the Ginkgo fail handler and runs the test suite with the name "Backend test suite".

### External Data, Input Sources:

- config.BackendConfig: A struct containing configuration options for the backend, including prediction options and LLM configuration.
- input: A string representing the input to the LLM.
- prediction: A string representing the prediction from the LLM.

### Summary:

#### LLM tests:

This section contains tests for the LLM module, specifically focusing on the Finetune function. The tests cover various scenarios, including echo behavior, cutstrings regex application, extract regex application, trimming spaces, and trimming suffixes.

#### Finetune LLM output:

This context describes the Finetune function, which takes a configuration, input, and prediction as arguments and returns a modified prediction based on the configuration options.

#### When echo is enabled:

This context tests the behavior of the Finetune function when the echo option is enabled. In this case, the input is prepended to the prediction, resulting in a combined output.

#### When echo is disabled:

This context tests the behavior of the Finetune function when the echo option is disabled. In this case, the input is not modified, and the prediction remains unchanged.

#### When cutstrings regex is applied:

This context tests the behavior of the Finetune function when the cutstrings regex is applied. In this case, any substrings matching the regex are removed from the prediction, resulting in a modified output.

#### When extract regex is applied:

This context tests the behavior of the Finetune function when the extract regex is applied. In this case, any substrings matching the regex are extracted from the prediction, resulting in a modified output.

#### When trimming spaces:

This context tests the behavior of the Finetune function when trimming spaces is enabled. In this case, any leading or trailing spaces are removed from the prediction, resulting in a modified output.

#### When trimming suffixes:

This context tests the behavior of the Finetune function when trimming suffixes is enabled. In this case, any suffixes matching the specified regex are removed from the prediction, resulting in a modified output.
